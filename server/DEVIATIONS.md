# Accepted differences from Python

This file records intentional differences that the migration Manager accepted. No new difference enters this file without that acceptance. Close an entry when Python adopts the same behavior.

## Closed: accepted held prompts survive a secondary Ticket-model error

The migration Manager accepted this difference during review of PR 712 on November 12, 2026.
Python commit `27e893ad8` now supplies the same correction in the migration comparison baseline.

Both cores commit the accepted receipt, settle the running phase and held sender identities,
emit the change signal, then invoke the secondary Ticket-model writer. The reservation resolves
in `finally`, including when that writer raises. The same secondary error propagates without
another provider write or committed append. This is no longer an intentional difference.

`server/tests/conversation_core_delivery.test.ts` pins this order in
`publication failure after receipt commit does not append or deliver twice`. It also proves
that a repeated sender identity returns its receipt and later backend news still persists.

- Projection rebuild uses TEMP tables on the single writer connection in batches of 500 events. Python uses a second connection. Results match. Sustained-load latency is not measured.

## Fixed measure and Goal depth budgets

The migration Manager accepted this policy on November 12, 2026, for Unit 12.

TypeScript uses fixed named depth limits and weights in `server/measures/configuration.ts`:

- Evaluation budget: 991. Each reference costs four units. Each expression edge costs one. Goal actuals start with two units.
- Formula parser budget: 990. Reference leaves add zero, date checks add one, and number/period checks add two. Graph traversal contributes its depth.
- Graph and demand limits: 991.

These values were calibrated on Python's HTTP call path. They are TypeScript policy, not a model of an interpreter stack. TypeScript reads no interpreter setting and retains these limits when Python's boundary moves.

The investigation used Python 3.13.5 with recursion limit 1000. The live server runs Python 3.12. Comparison CI also uses Python 3.12, on both Node 22 and Node 24. Python has no fixed depth contract. Its boundary depends on the interpreter, recursion limit, and call path. In the measured plain-reference case, the shallow helper accepts 248 edges. HTTP reads accept 247 and limit at 248. Twenty extra helper wrappers reduce the shallow boundary to 243.

The gating proof compares Python and TypeScript well inside the budgets, for plain and mixed expressions and independent Goal roots. At the boundary and its neighbors, it asserts the TypeScript outcome only. It records Python's answer as non-gating information. A Python stack change does not invalidate the accepted TypeScript boundary. The direct proof regenerates the Python observations on every run.

The first applicable TypeScript budget determines the boundary error. At total graph depth 992, the measured Python path reports graph nesting while TypeScript reports expression nesting. Both return validation status 400 without a new row. This error-choice difference is recorded with the informational Python boundary observations.

Python also crashes during response serialization for a sufficiently deep accepted formula. In the measured JsonDict response, AST depth 253 succeeds. Depth 254 commits the definition, then returns HTTP 500. TypeScript preserves the committed row and returns the same status, content type, and text through a deliberate, handled response-depth error. It does not reproduce an unhandled Pydantic exception. Request-validation errors retain their separate response path.

See [the measure README](measures/README.md) for the fixed policy and proof commands. Unit 12's Part 2 still supplies the Goal HTTP routes and populated Manager/Chief page checks. The independent-root seam proof does not claim those routes exist in Part 1.
