# Accepted differences from Python

This file records intentional differences that the migration Manager accepted. No new difference enters this file without that acceptance. Close an entry when Python adopts the same behavior.

## Closed: accepted held prompts survive a secondary Ticket-model error

The migration Manager accepted this difference during review of PR 712 on November 12, 2026.
Python commit `27e893ad8` now supplies the same correction in the migration comparison baseline.

Both cores commit the accepted receipt, settle the running phase and held sender identities,
emit the change signal, then invoke the secondary Ticket-model writer. The reservation resolves
in `finally`, including when that writer raises. The same secondary error propagates without
another provider write or committed append. This is no longer an intentional difference.

`server/tests/conversation_core_delivery.test.ts` pins this order in
`publication failure after receipt commit does not append or deliver twice`. It also proves
that a repeated sender identity returns its receipt and later backend news still persists.

- Projection rebuild uses TEMP tables on the single writer connection in batches of 500 events. Python uses a second connection. Results match. Sustained-load latency is not measured.
