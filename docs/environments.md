# Runtime environments

Panels uses one operating identity on the VPS: the existing UID-1000 `vps` user. Live,
staging, and Ticket processes are separated by explicit paths and launch configuration,
not by Linux accounts.

```text
~/Deployments/Panels/
└── current/
    ├── app/       deployed, Git-free application
    ├── data/      live database, files, config, locks, and sockets
    └── logs/      live logs

~/Coding/Panels/
├── source checkout
└── data/environments/staging/   persistent fake staging state
```

Live uses loopback port 8767 behind the existing Tailscale Serve route. Staging and
Ticket servers use dynamic loopback ports and run only while active work needs them.
The checked-in user units under `ops/panels-environments/` launch live, the dedicated
GitHub Actions runner, and backups. There is no staging unit.

Code paths: `src/planner/environments/`, `src/planner/cli/main.py`.

## Live

The live environment root is the deployment root. Its manifest and persistent paths
resolve beneath `~/Deployments/Panels`, and its state shares the deployment transaction's
stable `current/data` and `current/logs` directories.

```sh
panels environment prepare \
  --kind live \
  --environment-root "$HOME/Deployments/Panels" \
  --json

panels environment inspect \
  --kind live \
  --environment-root "$HOME/Deployments/Panels" \
  --json
```

Preparation records and validates the live contract but does not pre-create
`current/data` or `current/logs`; the first exact-app deployment must be able to create
the complete `current` layout transactionally. Live carries no source-repository or
credential-file path: the user service runs only the deployed Git-free app with the
`vps` user's normal provider homes.

The deployed user service starts
`~/Deployments/Panels/current/app/bin/panels-launcher serve` with explicit live paths.
It binds to `127.0.0.1:8767`. `systemctl --user` starts, stops, restarts, and inspects
the service without sudo.

Interactive commands use `~/Deployments/Panels/current/app/bin/panels` instead. The
global `panels` wrapper follows that command. The deployed command establishes its own
application root and exact SHA, preserves the rest of the caller context, and does not
enter the managed service launcher's allowlisted environment.

Live host migration is separate operator work. This repository change does not rename
the account, move existing host state, or alter Tailscale Serve.

## Staging

Staging is an on-demand foreground process from `~/Coding/Panels`. Its fake database,
managed files, and logs persist below `~/Coding/Panels/data/environments/staging`.

```sh
STAGING_ROOT="$HOME/Coding/Panels/data/environments"
STAGING_REPOSITORY="$HOME/Coding/Panels"

panels environment prepare \
  --kind staging \
  --environment-root "$STAGING_ROOT" \
  --repository-root "$STAGING_REPOSITORY" \
  --credentials-env-file "$HOME/Coding/Panels/data/staging.env" \
  --json

panels environment run \
  --kind staging \
  --environment-root "$STAGING_ROOT" \
  --repository-root "$STAGING_REPOSITORY"
```

Each run reserves an available loopback port through server startup and prints the
actual URL. Stop the process when active work finishes. `environment reset` restores
the canonical fake fixture without changing staging's prepared identity or paths.

## Ticket servers

Ticket servers run from isolated worktrees. Their database, managed files, Hermes
state, logs, locks, and sockets stay in the worktree's local `data/`; their loopback
port is selected for that run. Confirm the imported `planner` package and every
printed `PLAN_*` path resolve to the worktree before starting a service.

Stop Ticket services after active work, then remove their local state, worktree, and
branch at Closeout.

## Launch isolation and provider homes

Every environment launch rebuilds its process environment from an allowlist. It keeps
the `vps` user's normal `HOME`, locale, terminal, path, and temporary-directory values,
adds validated provider credentials, and supplies explicit contract-owned `PLAN_*`
paths. Ambient `PLAN_*` values are not forwarded.

Hermes, Codex, and Claude therefore use the `vps` user's normal homes. Prepared
environment manifests do not emulate another user's home and do not copy provider
identity or session trees. Manifests from the retired role-account model must be
re-prepared; Panels does not translate their account or generated-home fields.

Live, staging, and Ticket repository and state paths may not share or nest across
environment boundaries. Credential contents are never written to a manifest or
printed by inspection.

## Host status and maintenance

`panels environment status --json` reads local filesystem and process evidence without
contacting the Panels HTTP server. `GET /api/vps-status` provides the same sanitized
snapshot to the browser Status popover.

`panels environment cleanup` is a dry run. `--apply` collects a fresh inventory and
re-proves every target before changing it. It can rotate configured oversized logs,
remove expired backup temporaries, and prune verified backups beyond seven. It never
kills a process or removes a worktree, cache, environment, deployed app, or ambiguous
path.

## Handoffs

- **Production deployment** (`deployment.md`) — replacing the live app with an exact
  commit.
- **Database backups** (`backups.md`) — verified live snapshots and restore.
- **The command-line tool** (`cli.md`) — the command tree that exposes environment
  lifecycle verbs.
- **Worker orchestration** (`worker-orchestration.md`) — the scheduled-Ticket and
  worker-readiness loops the foreground server started by `environment run` owns.
- **Hermes gateway** (`systems.md`) — the external worker gateway whose homes stay
  separate between live, staging, and Ticket worktrees.
